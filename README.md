# Human Activity Recognition Trondheim (HARTH) Dataset Analysis
This project analyzes the HARTH dataset, containing motion data from 22 participants wearing accelerometers on the thigh and lower back. Key tasks include:

- **Data Exploration**: Perform initial analysis and visualizations to understand data patterns and correlations.
- **Classification Modeling**: Train Neural Network, Random Forest, and Bayesian Network classifiers to predict physical activities from sensor data.
- **Clustering**: Segment participants into clusters based on activity patterns using multiple clustering algorithms.

The project includes code, setup instructions, and a report detailing methods and results.
